<p><b>Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond leagues:</b></p>
<br /><p>
There are 4 main types of awards:
</p><ol>
<li>
based on total amount amount of BTC wagered in any given league. Once a player wagers a total of 1 BTC - he receives 10 points, then for the next total of 5 BTC - 50 more points, then for the next total of 10 BTC - 100 more points, for the next total of 50 BTC - 500 more points, and for the next total of 100 BTC - 1000 more points. Then the cycle repeats from the beginning.
</li><li>Based on the number of spins - each spin equals 1 point.
</li><li>Based on winning/losing streaks - each streak of 5 wins or 5 losses in a row equals 5 points.
</li><li>Based on rare wins - the positive multiplier on any bet equals the same number of points.<!-- For example, a 3x win on the bronze circle equals 3 reward points, a 25x win on the diamond circle equals 25 points--></li>
</ol>
<p>
***Depositing any amount of BTC automatically enables the alias reset option.
</p><p>Reward points received in any given league are only valid for that particular league, upon promotion to a higher league, the reward point count is reset.</p><p>Reward points are used to determine a user's placement in his league, and to determine the winners of our Monthly Prizes.
