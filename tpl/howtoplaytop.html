    <h3>Warning! Do Not Use a Shared Wallet to Buy Tickets!</h3>
    <p>Only use wallets that allow you to receive Bitcoin from the same address you sent from. If you're not sure, purchase a confirmation-enabled ticket. If you get no response, your wallet is not compatible. Note that tickets require confirmations before processing.</p>

    <h4>Don't have a Bitcoin wallet yet? We recommend:</h4>

    <li>Wait for your prize to be drawn, watch the jackpot grow. Your winnings will be automatically sent to your wallet</li>

    <h3>Buy Multiple Tickets</h3>
    <p>Multiple tickets can be purchased with one transaction. For example, to buy 10 tickets for the 1 day lottery, send 0.01 BTC to 1Prize1WfNVLyQFF3rmwFGkrmBMrgtBZYo. </p>
    <h4>How to Receive a Confirmation Transaction</h4>
    <p>If you would like to receive confirmation of your tickets being processed, send an additional amount of at least 0.00005460 with your ticket purchase, and it will be retuned to you during ticket processing.</p>
    <h3>Prizes are drawn at Midnight GMT</h3>
    <p>When the prize drawing occurs, the game winner is selected by creating an hmac hash of the transaction IDs from all of the transactions which were used to purchase tickets, hashed with the game ID. The smallest hex value that will allow selection from all purchased tickets is used from the front of the resulting hash. This "lucky number" is used to select an index from among the purchased tickets.</p>    


    <h3>Ticket Processing</h3>
    <p>We process tickets as soon as it's possible to do so using a standard Bitcoin transaction. When ticket processing occurs, a confirmation transaction is sent to the jackpot address.</p>

    <h3>Cut-Off Time</h3>
    <p><b><em>Buy your tickets at least 12 hours before the end of a lottery to ensure it is processed!</em></b> Once your ticket purchase has reached 4 confirmations, it will be added to the currently active lottery <em>at the time of processing.</em> If your tickets are processed after the cut-off time for your lottery drawing, they will be applied to the next lottery drawing.</p> 

    <h3>Jackpot vs. Ticket Addresses</h3>
    <p>The ticket address for a game is listed on the home page, and this is the address used to buy tickets for that lottery. The link to the jackpot address directs to the blockchain.info page for the address being used by the running lottery to payout the winning ticket holder. <b>Do <em>NOT</em> send BTC to the jackpot address, it will not be processed!</b>.</p>

    <h3>Consolidation and Payouts</h3>
    <p>Periodically throughout the game period, the transactions sent to the jackpot will be consolidated so that the winner can be paid in a single transaction. The fees used for this come out of the house rake.</p>
    <p>In some cases, when a consolidation transaction is made, the balance on the blockchain.info page for the jackpot address may appear to be different than the listed jackpot on our home page. The discrepancy should only last until the consolidation transaction (and the transactions it consolidated) have been confirmed</p>
