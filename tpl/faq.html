<h4>What are the Betcoin ™ Dice Player Leagues?</h4>
<br />
<p>In order to provide players with a fair and logically sound rewards system, BetCoin ™ Dice has established the following system of Player Leagues, Reward Points, and Awards:
 </p><br /><p>There are five different leagues, which progressively indicate a higher player status, as well as provide access to higher awards and prizes:
 </p><br /><ol><li>Bronze League: This league is for players, who have wagered any amount of bitcoin below 1 BTC. <!--If a Bronze League member hasn't wagered any amount of BTC within 90 days<change>, he is removed from the leaderboard--></change>.
</li><li>Silver League: This league is for players, who have wagered a total of 1 BTC after entering the Bronze League.If a Silver League player hasn't wagered a total of at least at least 0.01 BTC within 90 days, he's demoted to the Bronze League.
</li><li>Gold League: This league is for players, who have wagered a total of 10 BTC after entering the Silver League. If a Gold League player hasn't wagered a total of at least at least 0.1 BTC within 90 days, he's demoted to the Silver League.
</li><li>Platinum League: This league is for players, who have wagered a total of 100 BTC after entering the Gold League. If a  Platinum League player hasn't wagered a total of at least at least 1 BTC within 90 days, he's demoted to the Gold League.

<h4>What are the reward points?</h4>
<br />
<p>Reward points are used to determine a user's placement in his league, and to determine the winners of our Monthly Prizes.</p>
<br />
<p>Reward points received in any given league are only valid for that particular league, upon promotion to a higher league, the reward point count is reset. </p>
<br />
<p><b>Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond leagues:</b></p><br />
<p>
There are 4 main types of awards:
</p><ol>
<li>
based on total amount amount of BTC wagered in any given league. Once a player wagers a total of 1 BTC - he receives 10 points, then for the next total of 5 BTC - 50 more points, then for the next total of 10 BTC - 100 more points, for the next total of 50 BTC - 500 more points, and for the next total of 100 BTC - 1000 more points. Then the cycle repeats from the beginning.
</li><li>Based on the number of spins - each spin equals 1 point.
</li><li>Based on winning/losing streaks - each streak of 5 wins or 5 losses in a row equals 5 points.
</li><li>Based on rare wins - the positive multiplier on any bet equals the same number of points. <!--For example, a 3x win on the bronze circle equals 3 reward points, a 25x win on the diamond circle equals 25 points--></li>
</ol>
<p>
***Depositing any amount of BTC automatically enables the alias reset option.
</p><br /><p>Reward points received in any given league are only valid for that particular league, upon promotion to a higher league, the reward point count is reset.</p><br /><p>Reward points are used to determine a user's placement in his league, and to determine the winners of our Monthly Prizes.
